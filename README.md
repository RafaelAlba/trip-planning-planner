#Coding Challenge

You love travel and you can’t get enough of it. But there are just not enough trip planning tools out there. So you decide to write one that fits your needs.

Your new trip planner will be called:

###Trip Planning Planner

It will be the your one stop shop for planning trips that you want to plan.

It should have a list of all of your trip plans as well as a way to add a new trip plan.

Your awesome designer friend has mocked up some screenshots for you to follow. Attached are the mocks for what the list of trip plans should look like, as well as the new trip plan form.

Requirements:

- Should be written in Rails
- The new trip plan form should be submitted over AJAX
- Should support image uploads as well as cropping the images appropriately (360px by 360px)
- Order trip plans on index page by most recent
- The main nav should be fixed to the top of the browser window as the user scrolls
- Upload your code to github
- Bonus Points for User Management

If you have any questions feel free to ask them.
